# traktor-stems-to-virtualdj
Simple script that converts a directory of stems for Traktor into stems that can be used in VirtualDJ.

Before running, update the directory names at the top of the script.

This script creates a silent track for the hihats and puts the drums track on the kick.

The resulting file is 6 tracks: mixed, vocal, hihat, bass, instruments, & kick. I see that VirtualDJ is able to create these without the mixed track. I tried to do the same, but the results were poor when I listened to them in VDJ. If you figure out how to fix this, please let me know, as it will save a lot of space making room for more music.

Create backups before running, and have fun!
