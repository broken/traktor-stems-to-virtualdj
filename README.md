# traktor-stems-to-virtualdj
Simple script that converts a directory of stems for Traktor into stems that can be used in VirtualDJ.

Before running, update the directory names at the top of the script. Also, you will need to have ffmpeg, MP4Box, and Python installed.

This script creates a file consisting of 6 tracks: mixed, vocal, hihat, bass, instruments, & kick. It uses a silent track for the hihats and puts the drums track on the kick.

Create backups before running, and have fun!
